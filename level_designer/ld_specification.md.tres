## Header

### Metadata
- Format version
	+ 8 bit format version (unlikely that we'll ever exceed 256 versions, but if we somehow do, the format would be so drastically different from version 0 that it would fail anyway and we could handle that)

### Level Info
- Title
	+ UniString
- Description
	+ Unistring
- Author
	+ UniString
- Mission list
	+ Levels can have an arbitrary number of missions
	+ Each mission has a UniString title and description
	+ The list terminates with two U+0000 chars

## Body

### Item Dictionary
- Classes are defined in terms of each other
- Each new class is a reference to another class plus some additional data
- Classes can have a placement flag in order to place them in the level (any missing properties take default value)
- Classes can have multiple placement flags, on the off chance that the author wants two identical items stacked in the same position
- TODO: bit arrangement

### Polygons
- Polygons are drastically different from any other kind of item, so require their own treatment
	+ Material ID (decides both the texture set and how the player interacts with it, e.g. ice material has ice texture and ice physics)
	+ Point array
	
### Pipescript
- TODO: IDK
