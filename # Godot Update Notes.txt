Notes are not complete, just what I've found so far.

Solved problems (that weren't just simple bugfixes):
- entity.gd uses move_and_slide_with_snap--which doesn't convert cleanly, as the snap function appears to have changed types in GD4.0.
- player.gd also uses move_and_slide_with_snap--search for TODOConverter40
	- See "future work" section
- tipping_log.gd also uses move_and_slide_with_snap
- feedback.gd had a string reading "Reference" updated to "RefCounted"
- LD field input_vector2.gd had a vec2 export's type hint duplicated
- warp.gd uses get_window().size in vars outside functions
	- Solved by marking vars @onready - observed elsewhere too
- Nodes named Camera have been renamed to Camera3D. These are 
  found in:
	- Player
	- Level Designer
	- Visual Pipescript editor
  referenced in:
	- ld_item.gd
	- camera.gd
	- fludd_spray_renderer.gd
	- player.gd
	- water.gd
	- camera_area.gd
	- bg_grid.gd
	- follow_viewport_workaround.gd
	- ld_main.gd
	- selection_handler.gd
	- node_placer.gd
- title.tscn is just completely corrupted, major data loss on all sides
- Likewise with any scene, it seems--see bug report https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/78893
- Terrain renders as magenta blocks
- RotatingBlock and telescoping objects' repeat flags have been unset.


Major problems:


Minor problems:


Editor interface problems (to do with variable export control):
- entity_enemy_walk.gd, "step_indexes" is meant to export as a bool array, but has lost the "bool" data.
- parakoopa.gd, "color" - update to Koopa.ShellColor
- interactable_dialog.gd exports a multiline string array, but apparently has lost the multiline flag.
- toad.gd has lost all spot and skin color names
- fludd_box.gd and fludd_pickup.gd have lost their Singleton.Nozzles typing
- pickup.gd has lost the params for respawn duration
- sm63_to_redux.gd loses the "FILE" modifier on a string
- Telescoping should be updated with direct node refs instead of paths.


Uses of OS.window_<> to clean up (not catastrophic this time):
- input_manager.gd has long lines


Minor text replacement errors:
- inter_scene_data.gd says "RefCounted counted" in the extends statement.
- character_sprite.gd says "Sprite2D origin is set to this"
- water.gd says "Transform3D it"
- visual_pipescript\node.gd has had func "text_entered" renamed "text_submitted"


Notes for unmerged PRs:
- For Background updates:
	- margin_<> in TextureRect has been renamed to offset_<>
	- rect_scale has become just scale
	- likewise, rect_size -> size
- For Paintings:
	- rect sizes need to be accounted for
	- can be made a toolscript for easier position setting now


Notes for future fixes:
- Console "report" and "rename" still link to the old vulnerable webhook
- Check idiomatic formatting of above report and rename calls
- Fixed player snap has much duplicated work between two updated calls of it.
- Tipping log: consider type hinting the "body" variable
- Parakoopas and Goonies don't extend Entity. In Goonies' case, that's probably fine (StaticBody2D), but....
- Koopa script needs style conforming.
- What is with Pipe's detector area size?
- Coins share a hitbox shape. Maybe share an external resource for that? (no need irl but REUSE ALL THE THINGS)
- FLUDD pickups too, sort of, but not quite.
- Sirius still needs to make falling log sounds.
